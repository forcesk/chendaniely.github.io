Susan Ambrose's book ["How Learning Works"][1] is probably one of the best investments for people who teach.
The next best (time) investment is reading Greg Wilson's paper on ["Software Carpentry: lessons learned"][2].

I've watched Greg Wilson's corresponding [PyCon 2014][3] and [SciPy 2014][4] talk numerous times,
and is well worth the listen.
