I've been asked a few times about whether one should attend graduate school.
I usually follow up by asking whether they are planning to do a Master's or a Doctorate.

If it's a master's, sure, why not.
Master's programs are typically no longer than 2 years and very well structured.
You come in with a cohort of students, and everyone struggles together and becomes friends.

PhD programs are much more variable and different.
First, the cohort of students are much smaller.
Second, unless there is Master's along the way,
PhD programs will be unique to each student.
Meaning you'll struggle on your own.
It's important to consider your current support network when thinking about PhD programs.
I cannot stress this enough.
It's a stressful, lonely, and isolating world out there,
and you really need to make sure you have a solid support network to help you though the ups and downs.
There is an [awful cost][1] to getting a PhD,
and there's a reason why [mental health][2] disorders are common among PhD students
