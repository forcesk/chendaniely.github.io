As the semester comes to an end,
preparing for my lab's [Data Science for the Public Good Program][1] begins.
I've started a [GitHub group][2] to dump the various components we will be using during the summer.

<!-- more -->

[Aaron Schroeder][3] and I will be the main trainers for the students this summer.
It's our job to teach the students the basic tools needed to be functional in the lab.
We put our initial syllabus in the [workshop][4] repository.

As soon as the semester ends I should have about 2 weeks to finalize all the things to be taught.
Ideally, this workshop repository will be come the basis for a university course in the future.
I know the university library is currently getting numerous people Software-Carpentry Instructors
so they can be more independent in teaching the Software Carpentry materials.
Hopefully by the end of the summer, the DSPG syllabus will be worked out to a point that I can present and show
the newly minted SWC instructors at VT, for them to adapt for their own needs.

In the meantime,
There are a lot of readings and things I need to familiarize myself with before the summer program starts

- [tidyverse][5]
- [R for Data Science][6]
- [bookdown][7]
- [purrr][8]
- [forcats][9]
- [tidyr][10]

There's probably more things I'm forgetting to list, but that's more than enough for now.

Not to mention I need to prepare my poster for [Society for Epidemiologic Research (SER)][11],
and pretty much finish up my book that will be the basis for my [SciPy 2017 Tutorial][12]
