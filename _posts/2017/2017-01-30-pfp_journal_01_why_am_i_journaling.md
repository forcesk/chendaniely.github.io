I'm taking ["Preparing the Future Professoriate"][1] this semester at Virginia Tech,
which is one of the core classes for the ["Future Professoriate Certificate"][2].

The class has us writing [blog posts][3] along with weekly journals.
Since I'm now transitioning into the phase in my doctoral program where I need to transition into writing papers,
just getting in to the habit of writing more can't hurt.

Let's work on just writing more,
then focus on tailoring my voice towards different audiences.
