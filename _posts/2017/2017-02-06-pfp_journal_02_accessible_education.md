In the United States,
higher education aims to be accessible to everyone.
Although historically, college and university degrees were mainly for privileged, white males,
throughout the years,
in order to decrease the socioeconomic gap,
more colleges aimed towards local regions and demographics were created.

From Historically Black Colleges and Universities,
to Land Grant Schools,
to Community Colleges, each `type' of College/University was aimed to be more inclusive.

This puts things into perspective and I've considered teaching at community colleges.
