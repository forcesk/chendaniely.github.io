Just got back from the 3rd annual [NYC R Conference][1] this past weekend.
I have been honored to be one of the few speakers for the 3rd year in a row.
This year's talk, ["So You Want to be a Data Scientist"][2]
gave a whirlwind tour of the tools and skills needed to be a Data Scientist.
I conveyed all this information in 56 slides and did it in 20 minutes.

The day before the conference,
I also ended up [presenting][3] my current work on behavior diffusion in social netowrks
and a little of my other work to the [NewYork-Presbyterian Hospitalâ€™s Value Institute][4].
This was probably the more nerve wracking things I've had to do recently,
presenting my research to a few extremely talented and smart PhDs doing
health analytics for New York Presbyterian Hospital.
But, we had a lot of good meaningful discussion during the talk,
that went overtime and we were kicked out of the room.
That has to be a good sign, right?
