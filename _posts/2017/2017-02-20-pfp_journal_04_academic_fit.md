It's always a good idea to take a break and think about all that's going on in life in perspective.
As I approach the end of the coursework phase of my PhD program,
I need to think about what's next.

My preliminary exam...

<!-- more -->

but beyond that,
I need to think about the (glorious) life after I graduate.
Do I go to industry? or stay in Academia?

Currently, my duties are closer aligned to that of a scientific research software engineer.
I enjoy building scientific software and tools,
and enjoy doing data analysis.
What I dread is writing.
Mainly because I am slow and terrible at it.
While this is a feedback loop that I need to break,
my disdain for writing means that I am not academically "productive".
No grants, no papers.

The past year at Virginia Tech and taking the Future Professoriate Class,
working in the library seems like a good academic fit for my academic toolkit,
or my love for teaching has directed me into looking into Professor of Practice positions.
