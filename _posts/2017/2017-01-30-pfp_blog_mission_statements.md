Mission statements and reflections on higher education institutions (plus one high school) that I've attended.

<!-- more -->

# Reflection

It's not surprising that the institutions that have a more specific academic focus, will have a more specific mission statement.
The Mailman school of public health's mission is devoted in improving public health, and
Stuyvesant High school, is focused on science, mathematics, and technology.

For the other Colleges and Universities, the missions are much more general,
and the ones located in New York City, mention the city, whereas Virginia Tech mentions the entire Commonwealth of Virginia.

Some background information about the Macaulay Honors College,
it is a college, but the students who attend it have a 'home' college in one of the various colleges in the City University of New York (CUNY) system.
I attended in the Macaulay Honors College at Hunter College of the City University of New York.
The fact that all the other mission statements are multiple sentences long,
makes me wonder if Macaulay's statement is meant to extend which ever home college the student goes to.

All the colleges and universities reference research,
it would be interesting to hear from the other members in the class who may not have attended research institutions and how those
mission statements differ.

Our mission is to continue and enhance that commitment by providing an environment which will nurture and enhance the special academic talents of the students admitted to Stuyvesant. The educational heritage of Stuyvesant is deeply rooted in the tradition of Science, Mathematics and Technology. This has been the foundation of our educational success and must remain the cornerstone of our educational program. Within this context, the goal of this institution is to instill the intellectual, moral and humanistic values necessary for each child to achieve his/her maximum potential as a student and as a caring citizen of the world.
