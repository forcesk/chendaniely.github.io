How did I get to where I am today.

This is my story.

<h2>Early</h2>
I've always been surrounded by computers.
My parents both studied Computer Science,
and my dad holds a Master's in Computer Science and works as a software developer.
Growing up, all my computers were company hand-me-downs,
but it allowed me to be lucky enough to always have a computer in the house.
I liked to tinker, not as a programmer, or hacker, but more of a user.
As a child, one of the first things I'd do when I open a program would to find the preferences tab of a program,
and learn what settings were available, and learn how to use a piece of software.

I competed in the ThinkQuest Internet Challenge in the 5th grade,
and co-authored an award winning website on Epilepsy.

<h2>High School</h2>
I was fortunate to attend Stuyvesant High School, a specialized math and science high school in NYC.
One semester of programming was a mandatory for all sophomores.
Looking back, I'm amazed the amount of material covered in a semester of school:
Netlogo (where I co-wrote a BlackJack game),
Scheme (where I wrote a visual calculator that worked with negative values, e.g., xx - xxx = -x),
and Python (where I wrote a strategy for Prisoner's Dilemma).

<h2>College</h2>
My undergraduate years was focused on getting into medical school.
I ended up graduating with a major in Psychology with a concentration in Behavioral Neuroscience,
and minors in Biology and Computer Science.

My high school experience in computer science was a bit traumatic,
and prevented me from programming courses until my final couple of years in college.
Bioinformatics was a major I was highly interested in,
but the math and computer science requirements scared me into Psychology.

I ended up in Behavioral Neuroscience because it was a small and new program mainly aimed towards the Honors Students.
Still focused on getting into medical school,
this was the best choice at the time since it gave me wet-lab experience and the
chance to work closely with professors for letters of recommendation.

During all of this I worked with Dr. Samuel Sigal in Hepatology at Wiel Cornell and NYU.
I was on the clinical trials coordination team and got to interact with patients
undergoing various Phase III clinical trials to cure Hepatitis C.

<h2>Masters</h2>
I got my Master's in Public Health because of the clinical research skills it would give me.
It allowed me to build on the basic statistics knowledge I had from college,
and learn the epidemiology and biostatistics skills for clinical and observational study design and regression analysis.
I was lucky to be in the Department of Epidemiology when Sandro Galea was Chair of the department.
Under his guide, the department had a big push to study complex systems approaches to public health.
Here I got to work with Kerry Keyes, Magna Certa, and Melissa Tracy in a R01 studying injury from alcohol consumption in NYC.
I also met Mark Orr, who became my Master's Thesis Advisor on measuring and simulating how behaviors spread in social networks.

I learned to love teaching when I was a Quantitative Methods (Epidemiology I and Biostat I)
Teaching Assistant for Dana March.
This let me to join Software Carpentry when I after a workshop led by Justin Ely and David Wade Farley.

I attended a Software Carpentry workshop when I took Introduction to Data Science during my Masters.
The course was taught by Rachael Shutt, Kayur Patel, and Jared Lander.
I learned R, and it changed my life.
What started out as a Master's in Public Health to gain clinical research skills before going to medical school
quickly evolved into Data Science where data analytics applied to health became my new interest.

<h2>Now</h2>

I'm currently at Virginia Tech in the Genetics, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology program.
My lab, the Social and Decision Analytics Laboratory, is in Arlington, VA,
and I occasionally have small consulting and side projects to help pay the bills and put
guacamole on my Chipotle.
