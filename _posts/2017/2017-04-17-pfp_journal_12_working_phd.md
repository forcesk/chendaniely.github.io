My lab has extended me an opportunity to be a research scientist and helping out our current senior data scientist
with the daily analytics and IT support the lab needs.
It's a very enticing opportunity, but I need to stop and think about my options

<!-- more -->

I'd get paid more!
What kind of graduate student would not want that?
But I would really need to consider and clarify with my advisor and rest of my lab how
this can fit in with my PhD.
I don't want to be doing my PhD longer than I have to,
and ideally I would be put on a series of projects that can be used for my final dissertation topic.
However, if I am a staff member of the lab, I will have less freedom of what my topic would be.
Of course, if I spent the after hours working on my dissertation,
I could do whatever I wanted, but that might not be a feasible solution.

The job will give me financial stability,
but currently as a PhD student,
I have a lot of academic freedom that I might loose.
Since most of my work is computational,
it can easily be done remotely.

Luckily my advisor will becoming to down in a few weeks.
We'll discuss this further then.
