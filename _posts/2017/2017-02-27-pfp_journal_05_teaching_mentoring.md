Software-Carpentry[1] has made be a better teacher because of the way we collect feedback during our workshops.
When teaching a technical class,
we use low-tech sticky notes to signify whether individuals need help or not:
Green for no help needed, Red for help needed.
This is extremely effective while teaching.
As an instructor all you need to look for is a red sticky note and you know someone has a question,
or if everyone has a green sticky note, the class is following along.

The python community is proactive in mentoring.
During the [PyData Carolinas 2016][2] conference,
[Carol Willing][3] talked about how small nudges and discussions can be enough to mentor someone. 
I've tried to be a mentor to my students I teach though my lab's summer program.
There is a misconception that mentoring is a 24/7 job.
It's not.
The right piece of advice at the right time,
can change an individual's life.

I think about the most influential people in my life,
and it's mainly a series of seemingly random encounters and discussions
that helped shaped the person I am today.
