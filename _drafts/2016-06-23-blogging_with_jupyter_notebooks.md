I'm trying to get into a habbit of writing regularly.
I've noticed over the past few years,
my ability to write a coherent English sentence is rapidly deteriorating;
I wasn't a great writer to begin with either.

Since I do a lot of programming already,
it would greatly help my cause if I could easily incorporate [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)

`jupyter nbconvert` has gotten much better since I've last tried to do this.
An example of exporting an existing `jupyter notebook` as a `markdown` file can be found [here]().

Brian Caffey describes the process in [his post](http://briancaffey.github.io/2016/03/14/ipynb-with-jekyll.html),
but it requires a bit of post processing to get images to render properly.
This is beacuase `nbconvert` will create images in a subfolder, so you need to link to them accordinly.

Luckily, something like this could be delt with in a `makefile`, or a really simple python script.

# Method 2: custom jekyll templates and python parser

The second method uses the existing `jupyter nbconvert` infrastructure to create a
